    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of pasta sheets, rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta, and a generous topping of melted cheese. The meat sauce typically includes ground beef or pork cooked with tomatoes, garlic, and herbs, while the béchamel adds a smooth, velvety texture. After layering, it's baked until golden and bubbly. Perfect for a hearty, comforting meal!</p>
